            <p>In various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism">theistic</a> religious traditions an <strong>Angel</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural">supernatural</a> spiritual being who serves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>. Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity.[1][2] Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, and servants of God.[3] Abrahamic religions describe angelic hierarchies, which vary by religion and sect. Some angels have specific names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or titles (such as seraph or archangel). Those expelled from Heaven are called fallen angels, distinct from the heavenly host.<br><br>
        
                <strong>Angels</strong> in art are usually shaped like humans of extraordinary beauty.[4] They are often identified in Christian artwork with bird wings,[5] halos,[6] and divine light. Throughout the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation and in all the important events in it, we read about spiritual beings called angels. Those angels witnessed the creation of man, accompanied him in his glory and humiliation, in his rise and fall and in his sinfulness and righteousness. They escorted the Lord God along the way towards redemption.</p>

            <p>Angels are pure spirits without physical bodies (although angels sometimes appear to and interact with human beings). According to the Bible, angels were created before the material universe and they were present when it was created. (Job 38:1-7 says sons of God (angels) sang for joy when God created our universe.) Angels also worship God (Psalm 148:2). Jesus said that angels do not marry (Matthew 22:30). They also do not die (Luke 20:36).<br><br>
                According to the Bible angels sometimes helped individuals. Two angels saved Abraham’s nephew Lot and his family before the city of Sodom was destroyed (Genesis 19:15-16). An angel provided Elijah with food and drink (I Kings 19: 5-8) Daniel was thrown into a den of lions but God sent an angel to shut the lion’s mouths and save his life (Daniel 6:21-22). Psalm 34:7 says that angels protect those who fear God.</p>

            <p>The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews describes the angels saying: “Are they not all ministering spirits?” (Heb. 1:14). “Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.” (Heb. 1:7, Ps. 104:4). <br><br>
                It is believed that they are pure incorporeal souls. It is also believed that even though they are spirits, they possess gentle, invisible, aerial body with no ordinary human needs. “The countenance” of the angel, who rolled back the stone from the door of the Lords grave after His Resurrection “was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.” (Matt. 28-3). The angels mentioned, however, in the Bible, appearing with sundry bodies and various forms, possess temporary bodies assumed to reassure people and encourage them to talk to them. Apostle Paul says of these bodies: “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit... The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthly, such are they also which are earthly: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.” (I Cor. 15:44-50). <br><br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> describes the pious believers who are to inherit his eternal heavenly kingdom, saying: “But they, which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.” (Lk. 20:35-36).</p>

            <p>Angels outdo human beings in knowledge, learning, power and ability. Due to the perfection of their nature, they are capable of predicting future inevitable events. They have extensive wisdom but are not omniscient. God alone is omniscient. <br><br>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms">Psalmist</a> said in his exaltation of the Creator: “What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.” (Ps. 8:4,5). The Psalmist addresses the angels saying: “Bless the Lord, ye His angels, which excel in strength, who do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His word”. (Ps. 103:20). <br><br>
                Angels worship God, prostrate in adoration of Him and keep, as it were, praising Him day and night. They are always ready to fulfill His will and His commandments. It is through the angels that God, the invisible, gets in contact with man. “No man has seen God at anytime” (Jn. 1:18). And God’s angels are standing before Him at all times. Their faces are covered with their wings, the way they were beheld by Prophet Isaiah (Is. 6:1-4). God sends angels to our earth for taking care of the believers, meeting their needs, guarding and rescuing them from their spiritual or corporal enemies. The Psalmist addresses the believers, saying: “For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone”. (Ps. 91:11-13) and “the angel of the Lord encompeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (Ps. 34:7). <br><br>
                The Holy Bible is full of services done by the angels to mankind in fulfillment of God’s Commands. When God drove man out of the Garden of Eden “He placed Cherubim to keep the way of the tree of life.” (Gen. 3:24).</p>
